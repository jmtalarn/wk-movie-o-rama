# Run the project
## Run the API
On the project root folder
    node api/server.js
This will start both an instance of MongoDB and the API server
## Run the react app
On the project root folder 
    react-scripts start
This will start only the React App development server
## Run both at once
On the project root folder
    npm start
This will run _concurrently_ the two scripts above
